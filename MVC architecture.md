## AngularJS MVC Architecture

- MVC stands for **Model View Controller**.
- It is a software design pattern for developing web applications.
- It is very popular because it isolates the application logic from the user interface layer and supports separation of concerns.

The MVC pattern is made up of the following three parts:

1.  **Model:** 
    - It is responsible for managing application data.
     - It responds to the requests from view and to the instructions from controller to update itself.
2.  **View:** 
    - It is responsible for displaying all data or only a portion of data to the users.
    - It also specifies the data in a particular format triggered by the controller's decision to present the data.
    - They are script-based template systems such as JSP, ASP, PHP and very easy to integrate with AJAX technology.
3.  **Controller:** 
    - It is responsible to control the relation between models and views.
     - It responds to user input and performs interactions on the data model objects.
     - The controller receives input, validates it, and then performs business operations that modify the state of the data model.
